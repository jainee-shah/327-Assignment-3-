How to run and compile EchoClient.java and EchoServer.java

Find where your java jdk bin folder is located. Copy that path, should be something like: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_152\bin
Open a command line
Type set path="<your path>" paste the path you copied from step 1. where <your path> is. Click enter. Now path is set.
Now compile your java file, cd into wherever you saved EchoServer.java
Once you're in the correct directory type: javac EchoServer.java and hit enter. This will compile the code.
Now type java EchoServer <port> replace <port> with the port you want for your server.
Open another command line and repeat steps 1-3
Now compile your java file, cd into where you saved EchoClient.java
Once you're in the correct directory type: javac EchoClient.java and hit enter. This will compile the code.
Now type java EchoClient hit enter
Fill out the IP address (make sure it's public, recomended using ipconfig and using your ipv4 address) , port number (same as the one you entered for server), and a message by following along with what the program asks for.
You should now be able to see the message you sent being received in the server command line and the message redisplayed in your client command line.
